aim : introduction to python exp no.1


theory : When you run a Python script, the source code is first compiled into an intermediate form called Bytecode (.pyc files). This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This two-step process allows it to be platform-independent.
Interpreted Language: Unlike C++ or Java, Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter. This makes debugging faster and the development cycle shorter.

Dynamically Typed: You don't need to declare variable types (like int or string) explicitly; Python determines the type at runtime.

Cross-Platform: Python is portable; the same code can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

Multi-paradigm: It supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Procedural, and even Functional programming styles.

conclusion : we learnt  to run prgrammes using python such as addition ,subtraction, division ,finding area, etc.
